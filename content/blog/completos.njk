                    Like in so many places, Chile has its own gastronomic culture, not that big and renowned like Mexican or Peruvian gastronomy, but with some interesting dishes with the flavor and magic that just latino food has. The street food is just another form of seeing this flavor in action. Today I want to share with you my favorite food that only exists in this part of the planet.

                <p>
                    “Completo” is the Chilean version of a hot dog and is one of the most popular street foods that you can find in Chile. The word “completo” means “complete” or “full” in Spanish; this name may be because this type of hot dog contains more ingredients than the USA-style hot dog.

                    I want to talk about the most popular version of this dish (yep, it has versions).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The “Completo italiano.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hot dog, besides the hot dog’s sausage and bun, has chopped tomatoes, mashed avocados, and mayonnaise (in this specific order). The name of this version is because all together they can kind of look like the Italian flag.
