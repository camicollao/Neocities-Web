                    Heeyy so, honestly in the beginning of the month I was feeling pretty bad, 
                    so I decide to make this halloween more special! I will see, play or read halloween media! or just kinda spooky or kinda have the vibe you know?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to organize this making a list with what I see each day since Octubre 5th until November 1th, I will try to update each week.
                    and separate the media with a  * if i never seen it before! (I want to see a looot of things from my watchlist).                    
                </p>
